This is a two part project utilising image processing and computer vision techniques.
In the [first part](Part1), a classifier is built to detect images of dartboards. A viola jones cascade classifier is used. The Hough transform is then utilised to improve this detector

Finally, a YOLOv8 object detector is trained on an augmented dataset created from 15 base dartboard images to achieve excellent performance.

[Part 2](Part2) utilises the circular hough transform and epiploar geometry to recreate 3d objects based on 2 images of spheres from known viewpoints. 
A [PDF report](Part2/ia21629-Part2.pdf) outlines this work in detail.
